Running the system immediately opens up the menu for Subscription Admin Portal, logging in as a user with Console.WriteLine. The program keeps looping after choosing an option and can only be ended by choosing option 5. Additionally, using DateTime.Now it inputs the current Date and Time registered for the new client.

- If the user does not enter an organisation name: "Please enter your organisation name." </br>
- If the user does not enter a valid number of users: "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number." </br>
- If the user enters a value outside of 1-100 for the number of users: "Please try again with correct input (Users should range from 1 - 100)." </br>
- If the user doesn't enter Y or N, it results in: "Please try again with correct input (Y or N)." </br>
